# PR: Sprint 0.5+0.6 Complete - Advanced AI Assistant with Complex Tool Ecosystem

## 🎯 Major Deliverables

### Sprint 0.5 - Complex Tool Ecosystem ✅
**6 New Production-Grade Tools:**
- web_search: Internet search with SerpAPI + DuckDuckGo fallback
- web_read: Web content extraction with BeautifulSoup noise filtering
- python_exec: Safe Python sandbox with pandas/numpy and timeout protection
- file_read: Multi-format file reader (txt/md/pdf) with encoding detection  
- tabular_qa: CSV/Excel analysis with natural language queries
- markdown_writer: Professional document generation with formatting

### Sprint 0.6 - Tool-Executor Routing System ✅
**Intelligent Multi-Tool Orchestration:**
- Smart Routing: Automatic Chat vs Reasoner model selection based on complexity
- Planner Graph: Structured task decomposition using LangGraph state machine
- Two-Step Tool Calling: Proper LLM → tool → LLM feedback loop
- AskUser Integration: Clarification handling in complex workflows
- State Management: Execution tracking with recovery mechanisms

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Systems Implemented:
1. Tool Registry System: Plugin-based with automatic discovery
2. Routing Engine: Complexity-based model selection with keyword analysis
3. Execution Graph: State machine for multi-step task orchestration  
4. Security Framework: Path restrictions, code sandboxing, timeout controls

### Quality Assurance:
- 56 Comprehensive Tests: 100% pass rate covering all tools and routing
- Error Handling: Graceful degradation and user-friendly messages
- Logging System: Complete execution tracing and debugging
- Type Safety: Full Pydantic models and JSON schema validation

## 📊 Key Metrics

| Category | Before | After | Improvement |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Available Tools | 4 | 10 | +150% |
| Test Coverage | ~20 | 56 | +180% |  
| Task Complexity | Simple Q&A | Complex analysis | 🚀 |
| Execution Modes | Single calls | Orchestrated workflows | 🚀 |

## 🎪 Architecture Highlights

### Plugin-Based Tool System:
TOOL_META with executor/complexity hints and JSON schema validation

### Intelligent Routing:
Complex keyword detection + tool combination analysis → automatic planner mode

### State Machine Execution:
classify_intent → planner_generate → todo_dispatch → tool_exec → aggregate_answer

## 🔒 Security & Reliability

- Path Security: File operations restricted to project directories
- Code Sandboxing: Python execution isolated with timeout protection
- API Resilience: Multiple fallback mechanisms for external services
- Input Validation: Comprehensive parameter validation with clear errors
- Resource Limits: Memory, time, and output size restrictions
